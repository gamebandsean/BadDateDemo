Bad Date Demo - Changes Made January 23, 2026
==============================================

• Portrait Expressions: Added preloading and caching for all character 
  emotion variants to prevent blank images during emotion changes

• Character Name Tags: Added name labels below the avatar and dater portraits

• First Impressions Phase: Changed the dater's final comment to be a 
  reaction/statement instead of a question

• Conversation Style: Updated the dater to ask fewer questions and instead 
  react more, share opinions, and add their own "color" to the conversation

• Interstitial Positioning: Moved phase announcements to top banners, while 
  keeping the Wheel and Plot Twist as full-screen centered overlays

• Plot Twist Summary: Added a new "What Happened" phase after the Plot Twist 
  winner is selected, showing a dramatic 2-3 sentence narration of the action 
  before the dater reacts

• Player Input Timers: Increased timers for Starting Stats (15→22s), 
  Phase 1 answers (30→45s), and Plot Twist input (15→22s)

• Lobby Simplification: Removed the Starting Stats and Tutorial checkboxes; 
  Starting Stats is now always on, Tutorial always off

Current Version: v0.01.61
